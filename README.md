# Overview

I made this to learn about rust and make a small project in it to learn how rust works. It is a fibbonaci sequence generator, where you input the limit to the number, and it generates a sequence up to that number for you. You can do this any number of times until you want to exit the program.

# Development Environment

I used the std.io library, and the Rust programming language book to help me with the setup. The rest was coded in VS code and ran in the windows powershell.

# Future Work

- A thing I could do is have the starting numbers be available to change by the user, to generate different fibbonaci sequences.
